                <h4>HEALTH</h4>
                <p>Finally, despite what you might have heard about kitty-to-human brain parasites, there’s a smattering
                    of evidence that cats could be good for our health.</p>
                <p>In one study, researchers followed 4,435 people for 13 years. People who had owned cats in the past
                    were less likely to die from a heart attack during that time than people who had never owned
                    cats—even when accounting for other risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and body
                    mass index.</p>
                <p>This was true of people even if they didn’t have cats currently, the researchers explain, which
                    suggests that cats are more like preventative medicine than treatment for an ongoing disease.</p>
                <p>In another study, James Serpell of the University of Pennsylvania followed two dozen people who had
                    just gotten a cat. They completed surveys within a day or two of bringing their cat home and then
                    several times over the next 10 months. At the one-month mark, people had reduced health complaints
                    like headaches, back pain, and colds—although (on average) those benefits seemed to fade as time
                    went on. As Serpell speculates, it’s possible that people who form a good relationship with their
                    cat continue to see benefits, and people who don’t, well, don’t.</p>
                <p>Much of this research on cats is correlational, which means we don’t know if cats are actually
                    beneficial or if cat people are just already a happy and well-adjusted group. But unfortunately for
                    us cat lovers, the latter doesn’t seem to be the case. Compared to dog lovers, at least, we do tend
                    to be more open to new experiences (even if our skittish cats aren’t). But we’re also less
                    extraverted, less warm and friendly, and more neurotic. We experience more negative emotions and
                    suppress them more, a technique that makes us less happy and less satisfied with our lives.</p>
                <p>On the bright side, that means it’s more likely that cats actually do bring us as much delight and
                    joy as we claim they do, although the research is far from conclusive. In fact, the vast majority of
                    pet research focuses on dogs, partly because they’re easier to train as therapy assistants. “Cats
                    have been left behind a bit by the research,” says Serpell. Yet another bone to pick with our canine
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>While we’re waiting for more data, I will continue to gush to everyone I meet about how happy I am to
                    have a cat in my life—and in my bed, on my dining table, and watching me go to the bathroom. What I
                    lose in sleep I make up for in soft, furry love.</p>
