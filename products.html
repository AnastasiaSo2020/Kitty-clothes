                <h3>THE SCIENCE-BACKED BENEFITS OF BEING A CAT LOVER</h3>
                <p>August 8 was International Cat Day. Cora probably started the morning like she does any other: by climbing on my chest and pawing at my shoulder, demanding attention. I likely sleepily lifted up the comforter and she snuggled underneath it, sprawled at my side. For Cora — and thus for me — every day is International Cat Day.</p>
                <p>Cats may wake us up at 4a.m. and barf at an alarming frequency, yet anywhere between 10 to 30 percent of us call ourselves “cat people” — not dog people, not even equal-opportunity cat and dog lovers. So why do we choose to bring these fluffballs into our homes — and spend over $1,000 per year on one who isn’t genetically related to us and frankly seems ungrateful most of the time?</p>
                <p>The answer is obvious to me — and probably to all cat lovers out there, who need no scientific research to justify their fierce love. But scientists have studied it anyway and found that, while our feline friends may not be good for our furniture, they might make some contribution to our physical and mental health.</p>
                   
                <h4>WELL-BEING</h4>
                <p>According to one Australian study, cat owners do have better psychological health than people without pets. On questionnaires, they claim to feel more happy, more confident, and less nervous, and to sleep, focus, and face problems in their lives better.</p>
                <p>Adopting a cat could be good for your kids, too: In a survey of more than 2,200 young Scots ages 11-15, kids who had a strong bond with their kitties had a higher quality of life. The more attached they were, the more they felt fit, energetic, and attentive and less sad and lonely; and the more they enjoyed their time alone, at leisure, and at school.</p>
                <p>With their gravity-defying antics and yoga-like sleeping postures, cats may also cajole us out of our bad moods. In one study, people with cats reported experiencing fewer negative emotions and feelings of seclusion than people without cats. In fact, singles with cats were in a bad mood less often than people with a cat and a partner. (Your cat is never late for dinner, after all.)</p>
                <p>Even Internet cats can make us smile. People who watch cat videos online say that they feel less negative emotion afterward (less anxiety, annoyance, and sadness) and more positive feelings (more hope, happiness, and contentment). Admittedly, as the researchers found, this pleasure becomes a guilty one if we’re doing it for the purpose of procrastination. But watching cats annoy their humans or get gift-wrapped for Christmas does seem to help us feel less depleted and regain our energy for the day ahead.</p>
